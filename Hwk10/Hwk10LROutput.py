SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION WITH AVERAGE YEARLY NYC TEMPERATURE TIME SERIES

This program demonstrates simple linear regression using datasets 
  found at https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag. The datasets are time series data
  for the New York City average annual temperatures from 1895 thru 2017.

Please enter the following 2 datasets so the data can be used to 
  produce a linear regression data visualization AND answer the question:
How does the temperature trend compare to the average January high temperatures?

Filepath example: C:\CIS2532\Hwk10\ave_yearly_temp_nyc_1895-2017.csv

Please enter average annual temperatures file: 
C:\CIS2532\Hwk10\ave_yearly_temp_nyc_1895-2017.csv

Thanks! Now the JANUARY temperatures file: 
C:\CIS2532\Hwk10\ave_yearly_tempJAN_nyc_1895-2017.csv

Stay tuned for the data visualization...


Slope of file:  C:\CIS2532\Hwk10\ave_yearly_temp_nyc_1895-2017.csv
  is:  0.03157443458393719

Slope of file:  C:\CIS2532\Hwk10\ave_yearly_tempJAN_nyc_1895-2017.csv
  is:  0.01793999614072296

The NYC average annual temps simple linear regression line is on the top,
the linear regression line for average January high temperatures below it.

The New York City average annual temperatures are rising faster 
than the average January high temperatures for NY City.

Program has completed, Goodbye.
