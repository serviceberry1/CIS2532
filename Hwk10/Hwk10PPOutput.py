SEABORN PAIRPLOT GRAPH FOR THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING DATASET.

This program demonstrates a pairplot graph for the California Housing 
  dataset that is fetched within the program from the sklearn.datasets
  so there is no need for a dataset to be input by the user.

Seaborn's pairplot function creates a grid of scatter plots showing 
  features against one another. 

Note:  The pairplot diagrams work well for a small number of features
    or a subset of features, so that there is a small number of rows and
    columns and for a small number of samples so one can see the data 
    points. As the number of features and samples increase, the scatter
    plots quickly become almost too small to read.

Stay tuned for the data visualization...

Program has completed, Goodbye.
